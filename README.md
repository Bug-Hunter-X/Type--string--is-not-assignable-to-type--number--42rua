This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `combine` is declared to return a number, but it attempts to add a number and a string. TypeScript correctly flags this as an error because the result of adding a number and a string is a string, not a number. The solution involves ensuring that both parameters are of the same type before performing arithmetic operations.
